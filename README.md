RShellJS : Remote Shell
========

A Node.js module that executes commands remotely and returns real-time output.

## Installation

```text
$ npm install rshelljs
```

## Usage

First, install RshellJS project dependencies by running the following command in the root directory:

```text
$ npm install
```

Second, to have an idea about using this module, please run the simple Express demo application inside `demo` folder:

$ node app.js
```

Now, go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your default browser and explore the demo application.
